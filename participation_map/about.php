			Participation Map is a Moodle plugin developed in 2011-2012 by Thomas Lextrait and Brant Knutzen, funded by a teaching development 
			grant at the Teaching and Learning Centre of Lingnan University in Hong Kong.
			<br/>
			Brant Knutzen designed and developed the Participation Map (BushGraph) version 1 as a way to describe an online discussion both 
			quantitatively and qualitatively, and <a href="http://brant.knutzen.se/research/ICEL_2010/Achieving_Transactional_CMC_Brant_Knutzen_ICEL_2010.pdf" target="_blank">presented this research at the ICEL 2010 conference</a>.  
			Participation Map version 2 incorporates a scaled time axis, and is the design behind the automated Participation Map plugin.  
			The research progress was presented at a <a href="http://www.cite.hku.hk/news.php?id=367&category=seminar" target="_blank">University of Hong Kong TEL@HKU seminar</a> in 2011, and the research results 
			are currently under review for publication.
